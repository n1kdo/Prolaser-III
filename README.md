# ProLaser III Control Console

This code interacts with a Kustom Signals ProLaser III speed lidar unit.

It reads speed packets from the lidar and reports them to a web app.

I re-used the same electronic design that I used for the [Ham-IV Rotator 
Controller-Controller](https://github.com/n1kdo/rotator-controller-controller).  

This also uses a lot of the same software.
